This is a Ramen restaurant website. I have edited sections: index, section2 and section 3 to be responsive with Bootstrap. 
I have a few problems with the footer, if I make it "fixed-bottom" it will break with smaller screens and overflow with the main content.
If I make it "bottom" it will break with bigger screens. I did the best I could.
